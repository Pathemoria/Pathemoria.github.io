                    <p>My favorite book, actually! I remember, that it was also my very first Dostoevsky book that I had ever read!</p>
                    <p>Raskolnikov & Sonya continue to be characters that I am deeply in love with, as well as what they represent as written characters, often during my writing, I continue to think of them, as if, what would they do if they were here, in this scene that I myself had written. </p>
                    <p>That reminds me, I have something I need to go bring to an old lady, a family heirloom of mine, that I need to pawn. . .</p>
